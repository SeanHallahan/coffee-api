# Coffe Shop Api, with order edit and delete function.

For fourth year of my degree in Computing in the National College of Ireland (NCI) I apart of my Software Devlopment specialization will have to create my own API.

So for practice I created this coffee shop web app where users can add an order and view it on the incoming orders board, users can also edit and save there order as well as deleting the order.
Orders are saved to an API saved on heroku.

This application contains a lot of Java script as well as html and css.

Thank you for viewing.
